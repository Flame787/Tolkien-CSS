        J. R. R. Tolkien was born on 3 January 1892, Bloemfontein, South Africa and died on 2 September 1973, Bournemouth, Hampshire, England.
        <br><br> Best known as the author of the high fantasy classic works: <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Silmarillion">The Silmarillion</em></a>,
        <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hobbit">The Hobbit</em></a> and
        <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings">The Lord of the Rings</em></a>.
        <br> For most of his adult life, he taught English language and literature, specializing in Old and Middle English,
        at the Universities of Leeds (1920–25) and Oxford (1925–59).<br>
        <br> In private, Tolkien amused himself by writing an elaborate series of fantasy tales, often dark and sorrowful,
        set in a world of his own creation.
        <br> He made this “legendarium”, which eventually became <em>The Silmarillion</em>,
        partly to provide a setting in which “Elvish” languages he had invented could exist.
        <br> But his tales of Arda and Middle-earth also grew from a desire to tell stories, influenced by a love of myths and legends.<br>
        <br> The longest and most important of those stories, begun about 1930, was <em>The Hobbit</em>.
        <br> In 1937 <em>The Hobbit</em> was published, with pictures by the author, and was so popular that its publisher asked for a sequel.
        <br> The result, 17 years later, was Tolkien’s masterpiece, <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, a modern version of the heroic epic.
